# The guns shoot people

This is a mod for Quake 4 for IT266 Game Modding's midterm project.
It changes the guns (currently only the Blaster) to not shoot bullets, but rather small units have a small health and ammo pool.
These units are different based on the gun (tbd).
(Enemies will also drop items used for upgrading units.)
(Certain enemies are weak to specific gun-units, and strong against others.)
(You can force your units to swarm a specific spot using the right mouse button.)

* Bots that shoot the weapons for you: use your blaster near an enemy.
* Different weapons' units have different behaviors: (Use a variety of guns.)
* Bots have strengths and weaknesses: (Use a variety of guns on a variety of enemies.)
